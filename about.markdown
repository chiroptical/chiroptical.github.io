My name is Barry. I received my PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from The State
University of New York at Buffalo. I work for [Mercury][mercury] as a Senior
Backend Engineer writing Haskell. In my spare time, I am very interested in
learning programming languages. Currently, my language of choice is Erlang. I
occasionally stream on [YouTube][youtube] working on functional programming
topics.

Check out some of my projects:

- [Snail][snail]: A programming language with no semantics for gastropods
- [DeriveHasField][derive-has-field]: generate `HasField` instances for Haskell datatypes
